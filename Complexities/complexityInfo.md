# Time Complexity:
<br>
Time complexity measures how the execution time of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. 

It gives an estimate of the time an algorithm will take to run based on the size of the input (denoted as n).

 Common notations are: 

O(1): [constant.cpp](./constant.cpp) 

Constant time. The algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of input size.


O(n): [Linear.cpp](./Linear.cpp)
Linear time. The execution time grows linearly with input size.


O(nÂ²):[Quadratic.cpp](./Quadratic.cpp)
 Quadratic time. The time grows proportionally to the square of the input size.


O(log n):[Logarithmic.cpp](./Logarithmic.cpp)
 Logarithmic time. Time grows logarithmically with the input size.


# Space Complexity:
<br>
Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to execute as the input size increases. It includes both the memory used by the input data and any additional space the algorithm requires.


Similar to time complexity, space complexity is expressed using Big O notation:


O(1): Constant space. The algorithm uses the same amount of memory regardless of input size.


O(n): Linear space. Memory usage grows linearly with input size.
